# low-battery-warning

A simple bash systemd service to flash the keyboard backlight when battery gets low.

This is pretty much hardwired to work on my archbookair.
you should probably get it to work on your system though.

edit the code to work with your computer, and then `sudo ./install.sh` to create and start service.
